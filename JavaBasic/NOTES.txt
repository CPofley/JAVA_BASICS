this': It helps to point to current class or class's properties
'super': If we are extending parent class to child then in child class's constructor its mandatory step
         to call super() which initialize parent class first then child class

OOPS Concepts:
Abstraction: With help of Method Overriding / interface
Encapsulation: private fields and public methods ( Getters / Setters)
Polymorphism: method overloading / constructor overloading
Inheritance: With interface , abstract class
Abstract class: Which has abstract and non-abstract methods
Abstract method: Method which does not have body, Ex. public int calculate(int num1, int num2);

If we are making a method abstract in class then method should be labeled as abstract and class as well,
ex.
public abstract class A{
public abstract display(String data);
}
